# nf-core/proteinfamilies: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline. Most of the plots are taken from the MultiQC report, which summarises results at the end of the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [MMseqs2 clustering](#mmseqs2-clustering) of input amino acid sequences
- [Chunked fasta clusters](#chunked-fasta-clusters) derived from the MMseqs2 clusters
- [MultiQC](#multiqc) - Aggregate report describing results and QC from the whole pipeline
- [Pipeline information](#pipeline-information) - Report metrics generated during the workflow execution

### MMseqs2 clustering

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `mmseqs/mmseqs2_createtsv/`
  - `<samplename>.tsv`: tab-separated table containing 2 columns; the first one with the cluster representative sequences, and the second with the cluster members
</details>

[MMseqs2](https://github.com/soedinglab/MMseqs2) clusters amino acid fasta files via either the 'cluster' or the 'linclust' algorithms.

### Chunked fasta clusters

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `fasta_chunks/`
  - `<samplename>/`
    - `chunked_fasta/`
      - `*.fasta`: fasta files with amino acid sequences of each cluster
</details>

### MultiQC

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

Custom output MultiQC data includes a metadata file (multiqc_data/multiqc_family_metadata.txt) with family information such as: Sample,Family Id,Size,Representative Length,Representative Id,Sequence

This custom metadata is presented as a data table on the web page.

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
